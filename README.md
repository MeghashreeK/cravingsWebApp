𝐂𝐫𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 - 𝐀 𝐅𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐎𝐫𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐖𝐞𝐛 𝐀𝐩𝐩!

I've built this web app using 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐉𝐒, 𝐓𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐂𝐒𝐒, and 𝐑𝐞𝐝𝐮𝐱. The backend is deployed using 𝐑𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫 and the frontend is deployed using 𝐕𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐞𝐥. Here are some of its key features:

=> 𝐋𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚: Utilizes Swiggy's live API to display up-to-date restaurant information.

=> 𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦 𝐂𝐎𝐑𝐒 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐱𝐲 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐞𝐫: Built using Express to handle API requests smoothly.

=> 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐭: Add items to your cart with detailed quantity and billing information.

=> 𝐒𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 𝐅𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲: Easily find your favourite restaurants.

=> 𝐓𝐨𝐩-𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬: View a list of the top-rated restaurants.

=> 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐒𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠: Sort restaurants by price, from lowest to highest or vice versa.
